As many excellent apps you will find here, as many people probably miss their personal favorite. This is just a little collection of AppImage applications that are either waiting to be revived, only live in the form of mockups or even only in the heads of wishful thinkers.

If there is another app for AppImage you are missing desperately, feel free to [file an issue at GitHub](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageHub/issues/new) to get it added to the list (or develop it yourself and tell us about it).

__PLEASE NOTE:__ We do not develop AppImages. We simply add them to this directory of available AppImages. So if you would like an AppImage to be made for your favorite application, please ask the project that makes the application to provide an AppImage. Once that becomes available, we can add it to this catalog.
